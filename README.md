# ExactusCodeChallenge

Hello this challenge is created using .NET 8 and WPF, this is a  desktop aplication where we can test the 5 subroutines selected from the document.

The logic to resolve the subroutines can be found in the ExactusCodeChallenge/Subrutines.
The unit tests are in ExactusCodeTest/Subrutines (Unit test using xUnit)
or feel free to run the app and try them with an interactive and modern looking UI :)

Thank you
